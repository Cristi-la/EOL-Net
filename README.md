# EOL-Net

> *Know When Gear Goes Dark*

## üìñ Overview

EOL-Net is an open-source, vendor-agnostic service that aggregates End-of-Life (EOL) and End-of-Service (EOS) dates for network devices.  
Through a simple web interface and REST API, administrators can quickly check whether a given device model or software release is still supported.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

Below is a high-level roadmap for how I will build EOL DB in stages.

1. Project Setup & Architecture
2. Core DB Engine & Data Model
3. API Development
4. Web UI
5. Deployment & Monitoring
6. **Testing? Maybe‚Ä¶**  
   _Where I break things on purpose so tests can pick up the pieces._
7. *Ongoing Maintenance & Growth*
